<h1><img src="app_icon.png" />About Seeds</h1>
<p>
Seeds 4.2 is an app that can query a key/value spreadsheet.
<br/>
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alflabs.seeds" target="_blank">
<img width="256" alt="Get it on Google Play" src="https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/images/generic/en_badge_web_generic.png"/></a>
</p>

<p>
The app connects to a Google Spreadsheet that has "seeds" and "values" columns. <br/>
You can then search for seeds using a simple filter and
the app displays the corresponding values but initially hides them
till you individually click on them to reveal them for a few seconds.
</p>

<p>
    What is good for? I use it as a simplified flash card system. Say you need to learn a list of capitals, 
    click on any line to reveal the answer. Here's an example:
<p/>

<iframe width="800" height="450"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QFpBZQctz_8"
    frameborder="1"
    allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen>
</iframe>

<p>
    Note that the app <em>never changes the spreadsheet</em>. It only reads from it.
    To change the data, simply open the underlying spreadsheet using Google Drive.
</p>

<h1>Accounts &amp; Permissions Requested</h3>

<p> <img src="a - signin process.png" width="1024" /> </p>

To begin, sign-in using a Google account and follow the prompts the accept the Google Drive permissions.
The application uses the following permissions:
<ul>
    <li>Google Drive API in read-only access, to get the list of spreadsheets from the user.
        This allows the user to select one of its own spreadsheets.</li>
    <li>Google Spreadsheet API in read-only access. Once a spreadsheet has been selected, the
        app queries that spreadsheet for seeds and displays the values. The spreadsheet is 
        never modified by the app.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>
To continue, the user must select a spreadsheet. Note that the Android app <em>cannot</em>
create the spreadsheet, it has to be done by the user itself either from the Google Drive
app or from the Google Drive web site.
</p>

The spreadsheet must be created with the following simple format:
<ul>
    <li>Column A: Seeds (what the user searches for).</li>
    <li>Column B: Values (initially hidden til tapped by the user).</li>
    <li>Column C...Z: Optional comments/details for each entry.</li>
</ul>

Here's an example of Spreadsheet:
<p> <img src="about_sample_data.png" /> </p>

To use the app, simply enter a search pattern. The matching rows from the spreadsheet are shown and
then the user can tap each entry to reveal the answer.
